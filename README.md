# classification-of-fish-dataset
Overview:
In this project, I will analyze, visualize, and interpret key findings of the Fish.csv dataset. This
dataset comprises the data on different species of fishes, their size (lengths, width, height), and
their weight. By using several clustering methods, I will try to explain the best ways to cluster
fish data based on their related variables. And by using regression methods, I will show how we
can predict the width of fish based on their explanatory variables of size (lengths, width,
heights).

Why am I using this dataset?

I have done some extensive research on several sites to find an appropriate dataset for this
project. I had several options; however, I am using this because I do believe this dataset can give
me the experience that I can use in almost any other sector. For example, the fish can be replaced
by population and their certain characteristics such as the color of skin, ethnicity, religion,
profession, and so on. And this can then be used by companies or organizations for purposes
including marketing, allocation of resources, and so on. Therefore, as a future data analyst, it will
be helpful for me to apply this knowledge in any sector I am working on.
